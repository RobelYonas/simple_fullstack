# Fullstack Flask and React Project

## Overview

This project is an attempt to implement a fullstack application using Flask for the backend and React with JavaScript for the frontend. The primary goal of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how both backend and frontend technologies interact and work together to create a seamless web application.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python with Flask
- **Frontend:** React with JavaScript

## Objectives

1. **Learn Backend Development:**
   - Utilize Flask, a micro web framework for Python, to handle server-side logic, routing, and API creation.
   - Implement RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend.

2. **Learn Frontend Development:**
   - Use React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
   - Manage state and props in React components to handle data and user interactions efficiently.

3. **Integrate Frontend and Backend:**
   - Connect the React frontend with the Flask backend through API calls.
   - Ensure smooth data flow between the client-side and server-side components.

## Project Structure

- **Backend (Flask):**
  - Create a Flask application to serve as the backend.
  - Implement routes and endpoints to handle client requests.
  - Use Flask extensions as needed to enhance functionality (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration).

- **Frontend (React):**
  - Set up a React application using create-react-app.
  - Design and develop UI components to provide an interactive user experience.
  - Make asynchronous requests to the Flask backend using Axios or Fetch API.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain hands-on experience in developing a fullstack application.
- Understand the principles of RESTful API design and implementation.
- Learn how to manage state and lifecycle methods in React.
- Develop skills in handling asynchronous operations and API integration.
